Him: I saw you standing here, and I just had to come tell you you have the most striking sense of style I've seen all day. I'm Joe.

Her: Hi… I'm Tina.

Him: Hi Tina. How's your night going?

Her: Okay. How's your night going?

Him: It's going all right. So tell me, New York native or you come from somewhere far away?

Her: Nope, I'm New York, born and raised.

Him: Ah, all right. So you know all the secret places the tourists and I can only guess about.

Her: Where are you from?

Him: Right now or originally?

Her: Um… right now.

Him: Right now I'm a New York native. Well, not native, but I live here, if that counts for anything.

Her: How long have you lived here?

Him: That's a good question, how long have I lived here? Umm… I guess about two years, yeah? What do you do here in the City?

Her: I'm a paralegal.

Her: I might be a lawyer someday. Actually, I do more work than he does, and it's all the hard stuff, too.

Him: You like it?

Her: It's okay.

Him: Okay, well, why are you doing a job that's just okay? Why not find one that's amazing?

Her: Hmm, well… maybe I would work as a vet.

Him: A veterinarian?

Her: Yeah.

Him: Wow, that's different from being a paralegal. What, you signed up for the wrong school or something by accident?

Her: [laughs] No, I just thought there was more opportunity to make a better salary in the law.

Him: I see. Think you'll stay in the legal profession forever?

Her: Ehm… maybe like five to ten years.

Him: Then what?

Her: I don't know, that's a long time from now. What do you do?
